# Piano roll task

Unfortunately I didn't add any handlers for touch events, but I think what I've done is enough. There is always something to add anyway :D

Here is the link: [Live demo](https://piano-roll-cyan.vercel.app/)

UPD:

I've made a whole new repo with NextJS framework for better UX. Also, I fixed a few bugs, but I did it after the official deadline, so if you're interested check these links [deploy](https://piano-five-nu.vercel.app/) and [repo](https://github.com/richardpickman/piano).
